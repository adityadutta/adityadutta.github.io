	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<div>I am Aditya Dutta. I was born in New Delhi, India. I have been programming since the age 12.I was excellent in solving puzzles with my general
		instincts since I was 3 years old. With time passing by, I decided to study Science in high
		school to finally pursue a career in the gaming industry. With an analytical mindset studying game
		programming will enable me to further enhance my ability and urge to innovate and create
		something new.</div>
	<h3>Why did I chose Game Development?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>As a young boy, I was always fascinated by games and whenever got a chance, I used to enjoy
		playing various games available in video parlours in my neighbourhood market or during a local
		tour with my parents. Thereafter, I started spending hours exploring new games in my computer.
		The activity never lost its zest and as I grew up, I knew that I wished to become a game developer
		and started working towards my dream of developing games for the best names in the world.
		Gradually, with the growing passion, I have transformed my personal computer to a “Gaming PC”
		myself. I was confident about my choice and knew that it is the best option as per my interest and
		ability.</p>
		<p>The game which made me choose a career in game programming is Assassins Creed
		Revelations.</p>
		<p>I got the game on my birthday in April 2012. While playing it, I just fell in love with the
		gameplay and storyline. The protagonists, Ezio and Altair, made me feel like I was a part of the
		creed. The game was rated the “Best Assassins Creed Game” by IGN.</p>
		<p>The gameplay was so smooth that I didn’t notice sometimes that I was playing a game. The
		game mechanics were so advanced. The graphics were just mesmerizing and soundtrack was
		great. I then realized that I would also make a game like Assassins Creed and hence, my dream
		is to join Ubisoft and work on an Assassins Creed series project as a Gameplay Programmer.</p>
		</div>
	<h3>What are my future plans?</h3>
	<div>Additionally, I have knowledge in programming languages like C++,and C#. Some scripting languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
		I also have experience with Game Development Engines mainly Unity and Unreal Engine. Learning game development provides me ultimate pleasure and a sense of achievement
		everytime.</div>
