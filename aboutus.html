		<span>Bio</span>
		<p>I am Aditya Dutta. I have been programming since the age 12.I was excellent in solving puzzles with my general
			instincts since I was 3 years old. With time passing by, I decided to study Science in high
			school to finally pursue a career in the gaming industry. With an analytical mindset studying game
			programming will enable me to further enhance my ability and urge to innovative and create
			something new.</p>
	  <p>As a young boy, I was always fascinated by games and whenever got a chance, I used to enjoy
			playing various games available in video parlours in my neighbourhood market or during a local
			tour with my parents. Thereafter, I started spending hours exploring new games in my computer.
			The activity never lost its zest and as I grew up, I knew that I wished to become a game developer
			and started working towards my dream of developing games for the best names in the world.
			Gradually, with the growing passion, I have transformed my personal computer to a “Gaming PC”
			myself. I was confident about my choice and knew that it is the best option as per my interest and
			ability. </p>
		<p>Additionally, I have knowledge in programming languages like C++,and C#. Some scripting languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
			I also have experience with Game Development Engines mainly Unity and Unreal Engine. Learning game development provides me ultimate pleasure and a sense of achievement
			everytime.</p>
